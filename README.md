## Compiling

### Linux/Unix with X11

To compile this project, you need to install Qt 5 development libraries.

Then run

`git clone https://github.com/nurupo/ProjectTox-Qt-GUI`

`cd ProjectTox-Qt-GUI`

this project is only a Qt GUI, and does not contain the core libraries. To install them, you need to run

`git submodules init && git submodules update`

now compile everything:

`cd projectfiles/QtCreator; qmake && make -j3`

You should get an executable called Tox-Qt-GUI. You can run it by typing `./TOX-Qt-GUI` in the terminal.

(Note: you may also need to install NaCl encryption library for [ProjectTox Core](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core).)

### OS X

Installation should be similar to other Unix systems, but it is not tested yet.

### Windows
